**Ship clean. Sleep clean.**

PullBear is an intelligent commit & PR assistant designed to keep your codebase healthy, reviewable, and weekend-free. It ensures your commits are clean, ticket-linked, and standards-compliant — all without needing to remember a thing.

## 🐼 The Story

Once a polar bear, now a stressed developer...

Our panda friend couldn’t keep up with the growing codebase and tight deadlines. Sleepless nights and messy reviews turned him into the PullBear — a trusty sidekick created to help you review smarter, faster, and cleaner.

Now, he's here to help *you* turn back into a polar bear — rested, focused, and shipping clean.

- ✅ Auto-inject ticket IDs into commit messages (from branch names)
- ✅ Configurable position for ticket injection (prefix/postfix)
- ✅ Supports customizable ticket format using %TICKET%
- ✅ Restrict sensitive files from being committed (e.g., .env, *.pem)
- ✅ Custom allowlist for safe files
- ✅ Added custom hooks for custom validations

## 🔮 Coming Soon

> These are actively being worked on and will ship incrementally:

- 🔍 AI-powered PR reviewers (lint, pattern detection, risky code flagging)
- 📦 Self-hosted + API key-based validation engine
- 🔧 GitHub/Bitbucket/GitLab CI integration
- 🧠 Rule presets (project-style templates, like Angular, Conventional Commits, etc.)
- 👯 Pre-PR checks (file change limits, forbidden keywords, etc.)
- 🐚 Full-blown pullbear.conf.jsonc validation schema and autocompletion support

---

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

### Quick Setup

```bash
npx pullbear init
```

This will:
- Create a .git/hooks/commit-msg hook
- Link it to PullBear for validation
- Generate a pullbear.conf.jsonc with inline-documented settings

---
## 🛠 Configuration

PullBear uses a single pullbear.conf.jsonc file at the root of your repo. It is JSONC (JSON with comments), so it's easy to read, edit, and understand.

---

### 🧩 Example pullbear.conf.jsonc

```jsonc
{
  "commit": {
    // 🔢 Minimum number of characters allowed in a commit message
    "minLength": 10,

    // 🎯 Regex pattern that the commit message must match
    // Example: Requires the message to end with a period.
    "pattern": ".*\\.$",

    // 🧠 Extract a ticket ID from the branch name automatically
    "autoInjectTicketFromBranch": true,

    // 📍 Where to inject the ticket — 'prefix' or 'postfix'
    "injectPosition": "prefix",

    // 🔎 Pattern to extract ticket (e.g. PROJ-123)
    "ticketPattern": "[A-Z]+-\\d+",

    // 🧱 Ticket format. Use %TICKET% placeholder
    "ticketFormat": "[%TICKET%]",
  },
  "restrict": {
    "sensitiveFiles": {
      // 🔒 Enable check for sensitive files
      "enabled": true,

      // 🚫 Files to block from commit (supports glob patterns)
      "patterns": [
        ".env", // exact match
        "**/*.pem", // any .pem file
        "**/secrets.*", // secrets.*
        "debug.log" // debug log file
      ],

      // ✅ Allowed exceptions
      "allowlist": ["examples/.env.example"]
    }
  },
  "customHooks": {
    //need to be enabled then only hook will be called
    "enabled": true,
    // takes an array of Paths to custom commit-msg hook script (must be .mjs)
    "commit-msg": [
      "./custom-hooks/commitCheck.mjs"
    ]
  }
}
```
---
## 🧩 Writing Custom Hooks

You can create your own custom validation logic using JavaScript ES modules.

### ✅ Example

```js
// ./custom-hooks/commitCheck.mjs

export default async function (ctx) {
  const { commitMessage, branchName, config, ticket } = ctx;
  
  const now = new Date();
  const isLateNightFriday =
    now.getDay() === 5 && now.getHours() >= 21;

  if (isLateNightFriday) {
    throw new Error("🚨 Who commits on Friday night? Go live your life. ❌");
  }
}
```

### 📌 Notes

- Use `.mjs` extension for the hook file.
- Export a default `async` function.
- If an error is thrown, the commit will be rejected with the provided message.

## 🧠 Hook Context Parameters

Each hook receives a single `ctx` (context) object:

| Key            | Description                                |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `commitMessage`| Raw commit message being validated         |
| `branchName`   | Current branch name                        |
| `config`       | The full PullBear configuration object     |
| `ticket`       | Extracted ticket from branch, if applicable|
| `stagedFiles`  | Staged files in the branch                 |
| `changedFiles` | Changed files in the branch                |
